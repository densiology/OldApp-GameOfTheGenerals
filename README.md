# Game Of The Generals

This is an Android board game app based on a popular Philippine board game called Game of the Generals (GOG).
Played by a single player against a computer opponent.

## Development History

* I made this app in 2013, back when I started to learn Android development.
* Updated Gradle to make it run properly on Android Studio.

* At the start, player chooses difficulty level and is required to place all his/her pieces on the board.
* Each side takes turn in moving one of their pieces. The rules are the same with the actual GOG board game.
* The game ends when one of the flags are captured.
